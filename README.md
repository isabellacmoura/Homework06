# Plain and Powerful pandas

## First encounter: exploring the basics with pandas  
In the first notebook, I dove into the essential features of pandas — that library that turns tables into data playgrounds. It felt like opening a toolbox and realizing there’s more than just a hammer: there are wrenches, pliers, and even power drills.

## Digging deeper: combinations and possibilities  
In the second notebook, I focused on experimenting. I merged tables, filtered columns, and discovered how pandas allows you to play with data in a nearly artistic way. A true lab for analysis.

### What really caught my attention?  
**Graphs!** I’m especially excited to explore how to turn raw data into meaningful visuals. Whether through the elegance of **Altair** or by styling with
#plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
